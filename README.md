# Tableau Projects

Welcome to my Tableau Projects repository! Here, you'll find a collection of five different Tableau dashboards that I've created, each focusing on a unique aspect of data visualization and analysis. These projects were developed using real-time data extracted from various datasets on Kaggle.

## AirBnB Final Project

For the AirBnB Final Project, I utilized a comprehensive dataset to showcase a detailed analysis and visualization, which includes a wide range of data from AirBnB listings, reviews, and calendar information. This project represents the culmination of my Tableau skills, bringing together various techniques and insights. Below, you'll find the dataset used and a sample screenshot of the dashboard.

## Other Projects

The following projects were created using the 'vgsales', 'directory', and 'joins' datasets, which include a wide range of data from video game sales, store directories, and employee records. These datasets capture various details such as game names, platforms, sales data, store locations, and more.
